#
# Installs a released sendspin-cli on a Linux host and enables its systemd unit.
# Verifies SHA256SUMS, creates the service account, and starts the player only once an `output` is configured.
# Every root command is printed first and confirmed, or pre-authorised with --yes.
#
# Usage: scripts/get_started_linux.sh [--version <tag>] [--yes]
#        scripts/get_started_linux.sh --user <name> [--version <tag>] [--yes]
#
#   --version <tag>  install this release instead of the latest, e.g. --version v0.1.0
#   --yes            do not prompt before the commands that need root. Required when stdin
#                    is not a terminal, since there is nobody there to ask
#   --user <name>    run the player as this existing account's user unit. The system unit is
#                    installed and left disabled. Pass --user again on a later run: without it
#                    the system unit is enabled
#
# Environment:
#
#   SENDSPIN_CLI_TARBALL  install this payload instead of downloading a release. The escape
#                         hatch for a locally built archive -- `DESTDIR` staged and tarred,
#                         exactly as CI publishes -- and the only way to exercise this script
#                         before a release exists. It is NOT checksummed, and the script says
#                         so loudly rather than letting a skipped integrity check pass for a
#                         successful one.
